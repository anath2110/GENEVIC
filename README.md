## Introduction

- **A smart chat assistant.**
- **Augmented by Generative AI models implemented via Azure OpenAI platform.**
- The application supports Python's built-in SQLITE as well as your own Microsoft SQL Server.
- Designed to support novice to intermediate research in Biomedical Informatics.
- Run from your local host or Streamlit cloud.
- Tasks that can be performed with GENEVIIC:
    - **PGS Chat:** Retrieve information from and visualize any custom database.
    - **GeneAPI Chat:** Explore Bioinformatics websites via automated API calls.
    - **Literature Search:** Search for relevant literature evidence in well-known portals for a given search query.

## Features
### PGS Chat

- Retrieve information from and visualize custom database.
- Demo database: **Polygenic Score (PGS) Rank Database**.
- **Code Writer**: Auto-convert queries in natural language (e.g., English (US)) to SQL queries or Python code.
  - Show the top 10 ranked genes for Alzheimer.
  - Plot distribution of ranks for the top 100 SNPs for Schizophrenia.
- Download the query results as CSV for retrospective analysis and interpretation.
- **Query ChatGPT directly to generate more information or novel research hypothesis.**
---

### GeneAPI Chat

- Explore external Bioinformatics websites via automated web API calls.
- Demo APIs explored: **STRING** and **ENRICHR**.
- Generate **gene-gene interaction network**, one or more gene names as input.
  - Entire functionality of STRING API replicated as is.
  - Interactive in-app display of the network.
- Perform **gene enrichment analysis** with reference gene set libraries, given gene list as input.
  - Visualize the **network graph**.
  - Download the enrichment results as CSV and/or the visualizations in known image formats.
---

### Literature Search

- Search for **literature evidence in PubMed, Google Scholar, or Arxiv**.
  - Search in 1 or 2 or all of these websites at the same time.
  - Display the **name** and **links** of the articles for any given search query.
