## Introduction
- GENEVIIC is augmented by \textit{Generative AI} models implemented via Azure OpenAI platform.
- It supports Python's built-in SQLITE as well as your own Microsoft SQL Server.
- Run from your local host or Streamlit cloud.
- Tasks that can be performed with GENEVIIC:
    - **PGS Chat:** Retrieve information from and visualize any custom database.
    - **GeneAPI Chat:** Explore Bioinformatics websites via automated API calls.
    - **Literature Search:** Search for relevant literature evidence in well-known portals for a given search query.

## Features
### PGS Chat
- Retrieve information from and visualize custom database.
- Demo database: **Polygenic Score (PGS) Rank Database**. See [Supplimentary Materials](https://github.com/anath2110/GENEVIIC_Supplimentary.git) for more information.
- **Code Writer**: Auto-translate prompts/questions in natural language (e.g., English (US)) to SQL queries or Python code.
    - Use a question from the FAQ or enter your own question.
    - You can select ```show code``` and/or ```show prompt``` to show SQL & Python code and the prompt behind the scene.
    - Click on submit to execute and see result.
    - For advanced questions such as forecasting, you can use GPT-4 (if available) as the engine. 
    - Example prompts/questions:
      - Show the top 10 ranked genes for Alzheimer.
      - Plot distribution of ranks for the top 100 SNPs for Schizophrenia.
- Download the query results as CSV for retrospective analysis and interpretation.
- **Query ChatGPT directly** to generate more information or novel research hypothesis.
---

### Gene API Chat

- Explore external Bioinformatics websites via automated web API calls.
- Demo APIs explored: **STRING** and **ENRICHR**.
- Generate **gene-gene interaction network**, one or more gene names as input.
  - Entire functionality of STRING API replicated as is.
  - Interactive in-app display of the network.
- Perform **gene enrichment analysis** with reference gene set libraries, given gene list as input.
  - Visualize the **network graph**.
  - Download the enrichment results as CSV and/or the visualizations in known image formats.
---

### Literature Search

- Search for **literature evidence in PubMed, Google Scholar, or Arxiv**.
- Search in 1 or 2 or all of these websites at the same time.
	- Example search queries:
 		- Search for articles with gene APOE and Alzheimer in Pubmed
   		- Search for articles with Schizophrenia in Google Scholar
     		- articles with gene TREM2 and Schizophrenia in Arxiv
     		- Search for articles with APOE gene name and trait Alzheiemr	 	 	 	 
- Displays the **name** and **links** of the articles for any given search query.
- Displays the **abstract** of the article, given its link as search query.
 	- Example:
    		- [Link to the article](https://link-to-your-article)
